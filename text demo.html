<p id= "para1">CSS document consists of one or more style rules. A rule consists of a selector that
identifies the HTML element or elements that will be affected, followed by a series of
property:value pairs (each pair is also called a declaration).</p>

<p id="para2">The series of declarations is also called the declaration block. As one can see in
the illustration, a declaration block can be together on a single line, or spread across
multiple lines.</p>
