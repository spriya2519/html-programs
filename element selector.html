<h1> Selectors</h1>

<p>Every CSS rule begins with a selector. The selector identifies which element or elements
in the HTML document will be affected by the declarations in the rule.</p>

<p>Another way of thinking of selectors is that they are a pattern that is used by the
browser to select the HTML elements that will receive the style. As you will see later
in this chapter, there are a variety of ways to write selectors.</p>
