<h1>BACKGROUND</h1>

<p id= "para1">CSS document consists of one or more style rules. A rule consists of a selector that
identifies the HTML element or elements that will be affected, followed by a series of
property:value pairs (each pair is also called a declaration).</p>

<div id="para2">
<h1>Sloth Bear</h1>
<p>Sloth bears have shaggy, dusty-black coats; pale, short-haired muzzles; and long, curved claws which they use to excavate termites and ants. A cream-colored “V” or “Y” shape usually marks their chests. Their shaggy fur does not have an undercoat, so it keeps them relatively cool in their native, warm climate and protects them from tropical insects. Sloth bears' nostrils can close completely, protecting the animals from dust or insects when raiding termite nests or beehives. They have a keen sense of smell, as well as near-sight similar to that of humans.</p></div>
